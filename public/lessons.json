      "content": "The paradox of thrift suggests that while saving money is good for individuals, if everyone saves simultaneously during a recession, it reduces overall demand and worsens the economic downturn. This counterintuitive concept shows how individually rational behavior can lead to collectively harmful outcomes. It was popularized by economist John Maynard Keynes during the Great Depression.",

      "category": "Language",
      "content": "Between 1400 and 1700, English underwent a massive pronunciation change called the Great Vowel Shift. Long vowels systematically changed their pronunciation, which is why English spelling often seems disconnected from pronunciation. This linguistic transformation is why words like 'bite' and 'meet' sound nothing like they did in Chaucer's time.",
