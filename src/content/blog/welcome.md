Every day, life teaches us something new. A conversation that shifts our perspective. A mistake that reveals a better way. A quiet moment of clarity. These lessons are precious, but they're also fleeting.

## Why We Built Knowly

How many times have you had a profound realization, only to forget it weeks later? We've all been there. That's why we created Knowly - a simple app designed to help you capture, organize, and remember the lessons that matter most.
